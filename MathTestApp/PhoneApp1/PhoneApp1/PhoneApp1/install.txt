Roadkill .NET Wiki engine
http://roadkill.codeplex.com
Version 1.7

Pre-requisites:
------------------------
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
* Microsoft IIS7/IIS 7.5 Express or later (there is also limited Mono on Linux with Apache support).

Installation
------------------------
1) Create your website or virtual directory in IIS.
2) If using SQL Server: create a database and assign it a login.
3) Copy the contents of the roadkill folder to the IIS directory you previously made.
4) Point your browser to the URL you are using - the installer will do the rest for you.

Your application pool should be run as a user who has permission to write to the site directory.
This is usually done for you already by IIS with the IUSR user.
